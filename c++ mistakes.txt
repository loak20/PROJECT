1. initializing  int n and then not inputting it using cin>>n ; 

2. i have to study how to deal with long int and things .

3. Recursion -
 - calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems. 
 -Many more recursive calls can be generated as and when required. 
 -we should provide a certain case in order to terminate this recursion process.

4. Structure members cannot be initialized with the declaration.

5. modulus properties - (a+b)%m = (a%m + b%m)%m 
                                           (a*b)%m = (a%m * b%m)%m
